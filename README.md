# little-ant-maps
How would a little ant see the world around it?

---

This project is about altitude/elevation maps. How to create them, distribute them and be able to fulfill user's need for this kind of data.

We feel that maps lack some important capabilities, we are not saying it is easy to implement and we still don't have a fully defined, working prototype, but we think something can be done.

First, we feel elevation data should be 3D or easily translatable to 3D.

## User cases
- Walking users
- Cycling users
- Reduced mobility
